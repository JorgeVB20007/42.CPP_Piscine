	DEEP THOUGHT
	(deep and sonorous)
What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest computer of all time have been called into existence?

	LUNKWILL
Your task, O computer...

	FOOK
Hang on. Did you say second greatest?

	DEEP THOUGHT
Second greatest. Yes.

	FOOK
But we designed you to be the greatest computer so you could...

	LUNKWILL
You're not talking about the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all the atoms in a star in a millisecond?

	DEEP THOUGHT
The Milliard Gargantubrain? A mere abacus, mention it not.

	FOOK
The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler then?

	DEEP THOUGHT
The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler could argue all four legs off an Arcturan Megadonkey, but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards.

	FOOK
Then what's the problem?

	DEEP THOUGHT
I am the greatest computer you are able to design without my help. Which, one day, you are going to need.

	LUNKWILL
	(to Fook)
Let's just ask the question.

	FOOK
Oh Deep Thought, your task is this. We
want you to tell us -- the Answer.

Long pause. Deep Thought bleeps and bloops.

	DEEP THOUGHT
The Answer...to what?

	LUNKWILL
You know. The answer. To Life...the Universe...Everything.

	FOOK
We'd really like an answer. Something simple. Can you do it?

	DEEP THOUGHT
The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. Yes. There is an answer. But I'll have to think about it.

Lunkwill glances at his time piece, Fook at the expectant throng behind them. They wait.

	DEEP THOUGHT (CONT'D)
Return to this place in exactly... seven and a half million years.

	LUNKWILL & FOOK
What?!

	DEEP THOUGHT
Can I help you?

	FOOK
Deep Thought.	Do you have...

	DEEP THOUGHT
An answer for you? Yes. I have.

	FOOK
There really is an answer?

	DEEP THOUGHT
Yes. There really is one.

	FOOK
	(almost strangled with emotion)
Oh!

	LUNKWILL
Can you tell us what it is?

	DEEP THOUGHT
Yes. Though I don't think you're going to like it.

	FOOK
Doesn't matter! We must know it!

	DEEP THOUGHT
You're really not going to like it.

	FOOK
Tell us!

	DEEP THOUGHT
Alright. The answer to the ultimate question ...

	LUNKWILL
Yes ...

	DEEP THOUGHT
... of Life, the Universe, and Everything ...

	FOOK
Yes!

	DEEP THOUGHT
... is ...

	CROWD
Yes ...!

	DEEP THOUGHT
	(longest pause yet)
Forty two.

The surrounding crowd is stunned. More MUTTERING.

	DEEP THOUGHT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
I checked it thoroughly. It would have been simpler, of course, to have known what the actual question was.

	LUNKWILL
But it was the Question. The Ultimate Question!

	DEEP THOUGHT
Yes, but what actually is it?

	FOOK (O.S.)
Everything! You know ... just EVERYTHING!

	DEEP THOUGHT (O.S.)
That's not a question. Only when you know what the actual question will you know what the answer means.

	LUNKWILL
Give us the Ultimate Question then!!

	DEEP THOUGHT
I can't.
	(long pause)
But there is one who can. A computer that is to come after me, one that I will design. A computer to calculate the Ultimate Question, one of such infinite
complexity that life itself will form part of its operational matrix. And you yourselves shall take on new more primitive forms and go down into the computer to
navigate its ten million year program. I shall design this computer for you. And it shall be called...
